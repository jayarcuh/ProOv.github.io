# html-draft-ProOv

Hi! This is Jay ar again and this repo is for my first project - ProOv , a progressive overload trainer.
  - This will be my first full front-end project and I hope to eventually delve deeper into back-end and make this application very nice.
  - For this draft, I only want to use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS so I can learn as I go throughout the project.

- Any tips! or recommendations would be highly appreciated.
